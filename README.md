# Sabatier-reaction-PDE-solver
This is a matlab code to solve the mass and energy partial differential equations. Cftool can be used to generate the temperature and concentration profile along the length of the reactor(shell and tube heat exchanger).
MATLAB uses the in-built function pde-solver to solve the partial differential equations. Values of parameters like Reactor volume, void fraction, activation energy etc. is taken from 
literature and hence verified through various other Research papers pertaining to this topic.
